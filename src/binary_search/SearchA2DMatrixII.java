/* 240. Search a 2D Matrix II
Description:
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example:
Consider the following matrix:
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true.
Given target = 20, return false.

    // Solution: start from the right-top corner,
    // if the target is greater than the value in current position,
    // then the target can not be in entire row of current position because the row is sorted,
    // if the target is less than the value in current position,
    // then the target can not in the entire column because the column is sorted too.
    // Time Complexity: O(m+n)
